We have Continuous Integration (CI) tests set up using Jenkins. Each Pull Request will be automatically built and tested in all of the configurations the code is expected to support, using the Jenkins CI system. Pull Requests must pass all CI checks before they will be merged.

We also test each commit which is merged into master to ensure no breaks occur when merging. Additionally, on a daily schedule, we test some configurations which are more expensive to test in every change to ensure we still cover those scenarios.

Specifically, we test the following:

1. Do all configurations build and pass unit tests?
2. Do the files in the change have the required line endings?
3. Do the files in the change feature the required Microsoft copyright header?
4. Has the change been reviewed and signed off by a project maintainer?

# Re-Running Tests

Occasionally, a test will fail due to an intermittent issue in the Jenkins system, or for other intermittent reasons. When this occurs, you can request __@dotnet-bot__ to re-run a specific test or all of your tests.

To rerun a test, copy the name of the test you want to re-run from the list of checks at the bottom of the Pull Request, and write a comment using the following template:

```
@dotnet-bot test [test_name] please
```

For example:

```
@dotnet-bot test Windows x64_release please
```
	
If you would like to re-run all of the Jenkins tests:

```
@dotnet-bot test this please
```

For more specifics on when and how to trigger specific builds, please see:

* [[Jenkins Build Triggers]]
* [[Jenkins Repro Steps]]

# Making changes to the Jenkins CI configuration.

If you want to change or add build configurations into Jenkins CI, you will need to update the [netci.groovy](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/master/netci.groovy) file, and create a Pull Request. To verify the configuration change did what you expected, you should ask __@dotnet-bot__ to test the change to the CI, like so:

```
@dotnet-bot test ci please
```

If there are errors in your script, this check will fail. Once it succeeds, you can then view the configurations via the Details link that appears next to the resulting configuration item, and ensure that your changes to the configuration script did what you intended.

Unfortunately, from the Pull Request itself, there is no way to see whether the project will pass the new build configurations. For that, we will have to merge the change and see what happens on the subsequent builds. If failures occur, we may revert your change and reopen your Pull Request and ask you to correct the issues. If new builds are being run for the first time and that scenario was not already specifically supported, those builds may fail. The responsibility for fixing test failures may fall on you or the original developers of those tests depending on the nature of the issue.

Pull Requests and Issues regarding the Jenkins CI configuration will be tagged as [Continuous Integration](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Continuous%20Integration) so that we know those issues require special attention. It is strongly recommended that you open an issue to discuss desired CI changes before you submit a Pull Request, as these types of issues will almost always require discussion and coordination with other changes.

# FAQ

## Why did the EOL Check fail?

Most likely you're developing on Windows and the Git settings you're using are incorrect, causing you to accidentally commit Windows-style line endings in your changes, when we prefer to have Git normalize the line endings in most files (unless otherwise indicated in the `.gitattributes` file). Try running this command in the core directory:

```sh
git config --get core.autocrlf
```

You should see the value 'true' printed out. If you do not see the value 'true' printed out, you will need to follow these steps:

```sh
git config core.autocrlf true

# Check out a new branch which doesn't include the changes on the problematic branch (oldbranch)
git checkout master
git checkout -b <newbranch>
git merge --squash <oldbranch>

# Add and confirm your changes.  
git add .
git status
git diff --cached
git commit -m "<message>"

# Force-push your branch to update your Pull Request.
```
