The Chakra team is committed to working in the open. We implement new capabilities in public forks of ChakraCore that are in the Microsoft organization. Using forks keeps the repository leaner than branches. The following is a coarse version of the ChakraCore team’s backlog. The further down the list, the more speculative an item is.
* Acceptance of a pull request to Node.js mainline to include ChakraCore
* Turn support for [async functions](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) on by default
* Turn support for ES2015 destructuring on by default
* Turn support for the [exponentiation operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) on by default
* Modern debug APIs that can easily be bridged to the V8 debug protocol
* An implementation of ChakraCore on Linux
* ES2015 modules behind an experimental flag
* Time travel debugging working in Node.js
* Decode WebAssembly binaries into ASM.JS bytecode and execute using ASM.JS pipeline

We have not yet established a release cadence or criteria for creating a release.
