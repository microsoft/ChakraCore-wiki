Instead of [[Building ChakraCore]], you can get ChakraCore binaries through the [release](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/releases) page or the following channel:
 
* For Windows binaries, use [Nuget/MyGet feed](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/NuGet-Packages).
* For Linux/OSX binaries, run `curl -SL https://aka.ms/chakracore/install | bash` in terminal to download the latest ChakraCore release package hosted on Azure.

### Third party tools (not maintained by the ChakraCore team)
* On OSX, run `brew install chakra` to install the latest ChakraCore release package.

Let us know if you want to add or have already added ChakraCore to another package manager.
